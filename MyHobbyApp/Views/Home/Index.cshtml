                <h2>What is Spikeball?</h2>
                <p>
                    Spikeball, also known as Roundnet, is an exciting and fast-paced sport that combines elements of volleyball
                    and four-square. Played with four players divided into two teams, the game revolves around a unique circular
                    net positioned close to the ground. Players serve and spike the ball onto the net, creating dynamic rallies
                    that require quick reflexes, strategy, and teamwork.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an avid player since 2018, I've participated in numerous tournaments and witnessed the sport's incredible
                    growth. What started as a casual beach game has evolved into a competitive sport with professional leagues
                    and international competitions.

                <h2>Why I Love This Sport</h2>
                <p>
                    What makes Spikeball truly special is its accessibility and social nature. Whether you're playing at a
                    competitive tournament or casually at a barbecue, the game brings people together and creates endless
                    opportunities for improvement. The combination of athleticism, strategy, and teamwork makes every match
                    unique and exciting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through Spikeball, I've met incredible people, traveled to amazing places for tournaments, and
                    developed skills I never thought I'd have. The community is welcoming, supportive, and always eager
                    to help newcomers learn the game.
