        <h2>What is Spikeball?</h2>
        <p>
            Spikeball, also known as Roundnet, is an exciting and fast-paced sport that combines elements of volleyball
            and four-square. Played with four players divided into two teams, the game revolves around a unique circular
            net positioned close to the ground. Players serve and spike the ball onto the net, creating dynamic rallies
            that require quick reflexes, strategy, and teamwork.
        </p>

            As an avid player since 2018, I've participated in numerous tournaments and witnessed the sport's incredible
            growth. What started as a casual beach game has evolved into a competitive sport with professional leagues
            and international competitions.

            What makes Spikeball truly special is its accessibility and social nature. Whether you're playing at a
            competitive tournament or casually at a barbecue, the game brings people together and creates endless
            opportunities for improvement. The combination of athleticism, strategy, and teamwork makes every match
            unique and exciting.

            Through Spikeball, I've met incredible people, traveled to amazing places for tournaments, and
            developed skills I never thought I'd have. The community is welcoming, supportive, and always eager
            to help newcomers learn the game.
